    <h1>Child Safety Standards</h1>
    <p><strong>App name:</strong> Ganesh Bhise – Social worker</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Rudraksh Jani</p>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 9th Decemeber 2025</p>

    <p>
      The safety and dignity of children and young people are extremely
      important to us. This Child Safety Standards Policy explains how the app
      <strong>“Ganesh Bhise – Social worker”</strong>
      handles child safety, including the prevention of child sexual abuse and
      exploitation (CSAE) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM), in line with
      Google Play’s Child Safety Standards and applicable laws.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope and Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to all users of the app and covers all content,
      messages, feedback, and interactions that may occur through the app’s
      features. The app is primarily intended for adults to share feedback and
      views related to the social work and public service activities of Ganesh
      Bhise.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Zero Tolerance for Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</h2>
    <p>
      We maintain a strict, zero-tolerance stance toward any form of child
      sexual abuse or exploitation. This includes, but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any attempt to groom, coerce, or exploit a minor.</li>
      <li>Requests for sexual content involving minors.</li>
      <li>
        Sharing, requesting, or promoting explicit or suggestive content
        involving minors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Threats, blackmail, or extortion involving a child or their images.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Users are strictly prohibited from using this app to harm, exploit, or
      endanger children in any way. Accounts involved in such activity may be
      suspended or permanently banned without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Prohibited Content: Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)</h2>
    <p>
      We do not allow any child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on or through our
      app. CSAM includes any visual, textual, audio, or video content that
      depicts or attempts to depict a minor in sexually explicit or exploitative
      situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we become aware of CSAM being shared, uploaded, or reported in
      connection with our app:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We will promptly remove or disable access to the content.</li>
      <li>We may suspend or terminate the accounts involved.</li>
      <li>
        Where required by law, we will report the material and related
        information to the appropriate authorities or hotlines in the relevant
        jurisdiction.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. In-App Feedback and Reporting Mechanism</h2>
    <p>The app provides an in-app feedback mechanism that allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Submit general feedback about the app and the social work initiatives.
      </li>
      <li>Report harmful, abusive, or suspicious behavior.</li>
      <li>Raise concerns related to child safety or potential CSAE/CSAM.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you see any content or behavior in the app that may put a child at
      risk, please use the in-app feedback option to report it as soon as
      possible. You may also contact us directly using the email listed in the
      <strong>Child Safety Contact</strong> section.

        violations.

        investigation, subject to applicable laws and our privacy commitments.
